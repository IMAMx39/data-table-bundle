# Actions

In this bundle, there are _three_ kinds of actions:

* [global actions](global-actions.md), displayed above the data table - e.g. "Create new user";
* [batch actions](batch-actions.md), requiring the user to select one or more rows, e.g. "Delete selected";
* [row actions](row-actions.md), displayed on each row, e.g. "Edit", "Delete";

Similar to data tables, columns and filters, actions are defined using the [type classes](../../features/type-classes.md).
