## Documentation

The documentation is powered by the [Retype](https://retype.com/). The articles are stored in the `docs/` directory.

To locally preview the documentation, first, install the [Retype](https://retype.com/) locally.
The installation instructions are available in the ["Getting Started" documentation section](https://retype.com/guides/getting-started/).
Then, to build the documentation locally (and rebuild when change is detected), run the following command:

```shell
$ retype start docs
```
